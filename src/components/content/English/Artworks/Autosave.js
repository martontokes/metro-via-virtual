          Autosave: Redoubt is made to be a playable map for the computer game
          Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It is a site-specific recreation of
          the WWII bunkers and tunnels of the Kowloon Peninsula built by the
          British during the 1930s.
          <br />
          <br /> This piece taps into the dysfunctional military architecture of
          the historical site as well as the contradictions embedded in the 3D
          computer game technology for virtual archaeology â€” the more realistic
          the site recreation became, the less playable it became as a computer
          game.
