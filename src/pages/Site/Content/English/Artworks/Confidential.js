          <p style={{paddingBottom: "60px"}}>Confidential Records: Dual Metropolitans utilizes 3D animation to reconstruct the cyberspace of Kowloon Walled City and imagine what it would be like in the future governed by artificial intelligence. In reality, as an enclave inside Hong Kong during British colonization, Kowloon Walled City developed into a huge and comprehensive urban system. Ungoverned and outlandish, it has long served as an inspiration for cyberpunk-themed artworks. Kook’s project combines history, myth, and sci-fi narratives with digital media to dig into the aesthetics and architecture of dystopia.
          Vvzela Kook is a new media artist who mainly works in audiovisual mediums, including performance, theater, generative art and drawing. Kook’s works combine technology with her artistic practice to reproduce and convert urban cityscapes into an integrated virtual experience, guiding the audience on a cybernetic journey. Kook has participated and shown her works in Kathmandu Triennial, MoCA Taipei, Microwave International Media Festival (Hong Kong), PuSh Performing Art Festival (Vancouver), and Mill6 Foundation (Hong Kong)</p>
