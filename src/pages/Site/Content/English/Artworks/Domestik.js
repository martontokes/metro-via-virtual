        <h3>Domestik / Publik (2020)</h3>
        <h4>Riar Rizaldi</h4>

        <p>Domestik/Publik reflects the notions of sound and spatial knowledge as conceived by Indonesian domestic migrant workers in Hong Kong. The first part of the piece focuses on a ‘public ear’ while the second half is an investigation into a ‘domestic ear.’ A soundscape of Sunday at Victoria Park, the weekly women’s rights speech, public radio-karaoke, the soundtrack for Jaranan dance and a composed noise of domestic utensils are presented in this sonic-narrative that mimics the aesthetic of radio play.
        <br /><br />Riar Rizaldi works as an artist and amateur researcher. Born in Indonesia and currently based in Hong Kong. His main focus is on the relationship between capital and technology, extractivism, and theoretical fiction. Through his works, he questions the notions of image politics, materiality, media archaeology and unanticipated consequences of technologies. His works have been shown at Locarno Film Festival, BFI Southbank London, International Film Festival Rotterdam, NTT InterCommunication Center Tokyo, and National Gallery of Indonesia amongst others.
        <br /><br />Domestik/Publik is part of Riar Rizaldi’s project The Right to Do Nothing.
